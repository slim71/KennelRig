# KennelRig

System for a Raspberry-based rig to mount in the inside of a kennel to monitor pets

This is thought to be mounted somehow either inside a kennel or sitting outside, to keep an eye on our pets while travelling (maybe the kennel was transported in cargo) or simply when we are not home.

Inspired by our antsy little doggo, which seems to have a whole party if that day keenel does not feel good enough!
